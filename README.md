# Counting-Crystals

This game uses HTML, Bootstrap-CSS, and JS.
Each gem 'button' is assigned a random number between 1 and 9. The goal of the game is to click on these gems in an
order that adds up to the number displayed on the screen.

If the numbers are equal then the player wins and gains a point. If it doesn't then the loss counter is added to.

Either way, the game is set up to be relatively indefinite, so it can be played approx up to how high the point
counters can add until broken.
