# Counting-Crystals

This game uses HTML, Bootstrap-CSS, and JS.
Each gem 'button' is assigned a random number between 1 and 9. The goal of the game is to click on these gems in an order that adds up to the number displayed on the screen. The buttons are reassigned every game, so each value must be learned again in order to win.

If the player's number equals the number displayed then the player gains a point. If it doesn't then a loss is added to the counter.

Either way, the game is set up to be relatively indefinite, so it can be played approx up to how high the point counters can add until broken.
